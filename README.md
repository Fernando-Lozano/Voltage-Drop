# Voltage Drop Calculator
## Usage

## Why I built it!

This project was built with a twofold purpose: First, to develop my skills in JavaScript; second, I have made it
quick and efficient for on-the-job calculations, as I am a licensed Journeyman Electrician.

## Functionality and formula
It is a voltage drop calculator that speeds up the process in trying to find the appropriate conductor size or length.
The formula used is Ed = 2KIL/CM where:\
Ed = Voltage drop\
2 = constant\
K = resistance of conductor (cir. Mill-ohms/feet or meters)\
L = Length of conductor\
CM = circular mill area
